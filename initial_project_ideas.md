# Project Ideas

In this file (but not restricted to), you can use to get used to working on this repository and jot down project ideas to easily be shared with your mentors and to keep the history of!

1. **Have you ever wondered what it's like to fly to Italy for lunch and back home the same day, or to tour around France for one night? Wonder no more, with JetSettter you can easily get a list of cheap flights (<$100) for mini trips (same-day up to 3 night weekend trips) departing from your local airport. This app will show you that it's possible for anyone to fly somewhere, grab lunch and fly home the same day without breaking the bank or needing your own private jet. With the help of JetSetter, you can take affordable same-day or weekend trips instead of waiting to bank up a 2-week long vacation.**
   
2. The app designed to keep you focused on your upward relationship with God by being grounded in the Word. This app will help you to keep track of your favorite verses and categorize them for easy retrieval at a moments notice. Need help with memorizing those Bible verses? We'll have a game for that. Want to share your favorite verse with a nice scenic background with all of your friends? Consider it done. Want to see a side-by-side comparison of a passage using two different versions? UpWord has you covered.
   
3. This app would display the user with brief information about their favorite surf locations for the upcoming week so that they can quickly and easily decide which beach to hit up based on the predicted surf forecast (minimalist-type info). In addition to the forecast, they could make a user profile to connect with other surfers and create events to get a fun local group sesh going.
